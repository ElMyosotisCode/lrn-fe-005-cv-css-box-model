# Misael's F. End Learning Day-05 - "CV ATS Web Page part-05 and Finalization"

Hello... 😃👋🏻  
It's me Misael Randy Limpaty (ElMyosotisCode) your future Front End Developer Expert.

This project is the continuation and finalization of "ATS Based CV".

In this project finalization session, I did some Visual Tweaks, such as: ✌
- 🚀 **Refactored the entire page layout:** 
    - Pivoted from an initial straight one vertical layout into two Rows vertical layout, which are the Page Header and Main Content. 
    - Now, there is a Page Header row contains the Navigation menu and it's a Sticky Navigation to the top of the page.
    - Now, there is a Main Content row contains the CV content, which is also scroll-able.
- 🎨 **Implemented a "Floating Card" UI:**
    - Added a bunch of floating Card View utilizing `box-shadow` properties to create a depth effect.

💡 Here are some key points I learned through this session:
- **Understanding the CSS Box Model:** 
    - How to effectively use `margin`, `padding`, and `border` to create a visually appealing layout.
    - How to apply `box-shadow` for depth and visual separation of elements.
- **Responsive Design:**
    - How to use `max-width` and `margin: auto` to center content and ensure it looks good on various screen sizes.
- **Sticky Navigation:**
    - How to implement a sticky navigation bar that remains at the top of the viewport when scrolling.
